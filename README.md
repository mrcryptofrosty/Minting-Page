This is a [FrostySDK](https://mrcryptofrosty1.gitbook.io/frosty/) + [RainbowKit](https://rainbowkit.com) + [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh) + [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project).

The purpose of this repository is to get you up & running quickly with a custom minting page using the Frosty SDK (frosty-sdk).  The primary functionality demonstrated in this repo is the ability to mint NFTs from Frosty's 721A & 4907 contracts.  The deployment function used here can be copied to launch each of the other contracts included in the SDK.  This repository also demonstrates the Metadata Renderer module.

For a video tutorial on how to get up and running in <10min, please check out the [Frosty YouTube channel]().

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies using npm (note: ```yarn add``` has reported mixed results):

```bash
npm i
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
